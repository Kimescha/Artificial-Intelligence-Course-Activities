# Artificial-Intelligence-Course-Activities

The first assignment: creating an optimized maze player using Q-learning. I used Python Libraries such as Keras and MatPlotLib for this task.

The second assignment: solving an 8-Puzzle using algorithms like DFS, BFS IDS, UCS, and A*. 
I used Libraries like Numpy for this task and collected the output examples for the given instances.

The final project: creating an optimized Connect Four player using MiniMaz-Pruning and genetic algorithm. I mainly used Numpy, PyGame, and PyGad for this task and
implemented a Java GUI for the game.
